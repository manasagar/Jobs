## How it Works
The application is built with **Spring Boot** and follows a modular, secure design:

- **Spring Boot REST APIs** power the backend for job posting, applications, and user management.  
- **Spring Security** enforces role-based access control with roles like Admin, Recruiter, and Candidate.  
- **Quartz Scheduler + Zoom API** enable automated meeting scheduling between recruiters and candidates, with reminders.  
- The system is performance-tested with **JMeter**, ensuring scalability and reliability under heavy load.
